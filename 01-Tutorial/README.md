## Question 2

> Two End nodes Connected with the Straight Ethernet Cable. Where both end nodes are in the different network.

## Question 3

> Two End nodes Connected with the Cross Coupled Ethernet Cable. Where both end nodes are in the same network.

## Question 4

> Two End nodes Connected with the Cross Coupled Ethernet Cable. Where both end nodes are in the different network.

## Question 5

> What are ways (or technologies) two computers are directly connected and communicate with each other?

1. Ethernet (wired connection)
2. Wi-Fi (wireless connection)
3. Bluetooth (short-range wireless)
4. USB (wired connection)
5. Firewire (high-speed wired connection)
6. Serial Cable (wired connection)
7. Parallel Cable (wired connection)
8. Infrared (short-range wireless)
9. Near Field Communication (NFC)
10. Direct cable connection (DCC) using null modem cables
11. Cross-over Cable (wired connection)
12. InfiniBand (high-speed interconnect)
13. Fiber Channel (high-speed storage networking)
14. Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) over serial interfaces
15. Virtual Private Network (VPN)
16. Thunderbolt (high-speed interface)
17. Parallel ATA (PATA)
18. Serial ATA (SATA)
19. eSATA (External SATA)
20. USB On-The-Go (OTG)
21. Zigbee (low-power wireless)
22. Z-Wave (home automation wireless)
23. Powerline Communication (data over electrical wiring)

These technologies cover a range of wired and wireless methods to directly connect two computers for data transfer and communication.
